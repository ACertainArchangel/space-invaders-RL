# Questions about my project for Dr. Shukla

1. Do you think a project like this could feasibly continue with a $0 budget? If you were working on this, would a $0 budget constrain you and if not, how would you overcome the challenge?

2. What do you think of my current approach of parallelization? Do you have a better way that immediately comes to mind? Can my program be parallelized on a GPU (specifically the T4 I have access to) or would I have to do a major structural overhaul.

3. What do you think about my implementation of TD error prioritized repay? Is there a way to optimize it? Recomputing every training cycle is a bit computationally expensive but from what I can tell it seems standard.

4. Seeing as enough computational power for hyperparameter tuning is clearly out of my budget, do you think I am on the right track with my current method of testing T1 and B0B and adjusting their hyperparameters based on how I see them perform?

5. **Do you have any general advice about the project?** I consider this the most important question as you will for sure know best what it is I need to hear.
