The T in T1 stands for training, because instead of attempting to gather information on hyperparameters, it just jumps straight to the training part.

Here are some characteristics of the model:
- Monolithic
- Uses TD error
- Actually can run on my laptop because there is no concern for gathering hyperparameter data, even though it still uses expensive TD error prioritized replay.
